<h1>PIDs</h1>
<p class="Body">A PID is a parameter ID and is a GMLAN specific term. It is similar to DIDs with the major difference being PIDs are not static. They are dynamic signals that update throughout a test.  You have PIDs that you read as well as PIDs that you write (sometimes called CPIDs or control packet identifier). These are named Inputs and Outputs, respectively. An input PID is one that you read from the controller. An output PID is one you write and is sometimes called CPIDs or control packet identifier.</p>
